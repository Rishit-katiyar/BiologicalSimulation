# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the developer documentation for the BiologicalSimulation project! This document provides guidance for developers who want to contribute to or extend the project.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
BiologicalSimulation/
│
├── simulation.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── .gitignore
├── developer_docs.md
└── tests/
    ├── test_simulation.py
    └── test_utils.py
```

- `simulation.py`: Main Python script containing the simulation logic.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the project's dependencies.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing an overview of the project.
- `LICENSE`: File containing the project's license information.
- `.gitignore`: File specifying patterns of files to be ignored by Git.
- `developer_docs.md`: This document, providing guidance for developers.
- `tests/`: Directory containing unit tests for the project.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BiologicalSimulation.git
    cd BiologicalSimulation
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - **Windows**:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - **macOS/Linux**:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests, navigate to the project root directory and run:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*_test.py'
```

### Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write docstrings for all classes and functions.
- Ensure backward compatibility when making changes.

### Branching Strategy

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/new-entity`, `bugfix/collision-detection`).
- Make pull requests against the `main` branch.

### Code Reviews

- All changes must be reviewed before merging.
- Request reviews from at least one other team member.
- Address any feedback or comments before merging.

## Roadmap

### Planned Features

- Enhanced entity interactions.
- Advanced biological behaviors.
- Improved graphics and animations.

### Future Improvements

- Integration with external data sources.
- Real-time visualization of simulation data.
- Support for user-defined scenarios and parameters.

Happy coding!
