## Introduction üìö
This project is a biological simulation designed to model interactions between various entities. The entities include:
- **Bots** ü§ñ
- **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)** ü©∏
- **Tumors** üéóÔ∏è
- **Immune Cells** üõ°Ô∏è
- **Viruses** ü¶†

The simulation visualizes how these entities move, interact, and influence each other's behaviors in a controlled environment.

## Features ‚ú®
- Randomly generated entities with unique attributes.
- Movement and interaction logic for each entity.
- Collision detection and response.
- Energy and lifecycle management for Bots.
- Basic biological behaviors such as mutation, apoptosis, and DNA repair.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BiologicalSimulation.git
    cd BiologicalSimulation
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    - On **Windows**:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On **macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the Simulation**
    ```bash
    python simulation.py
    ```

### Requirements
Make sure to have the following libraries installed, which are listed in `requirements.txt`:
- pygame

To install them, run:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage üöÄ

### Running the Simulation
After following the installation steps, run the simulation using:
```bash
python simulation.py
```

### Interacting with the Simulation
- The simulation window will open, displaying all the entities.
- The Bots will move around, interacting with RBCs, Tumors, Immune Cells, and Viruses.
- Press `ESC` or close the window to stop the simulation.
