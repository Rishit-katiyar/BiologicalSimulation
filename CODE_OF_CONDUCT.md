# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community organizers and administrators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be temporarily banned or permanently expelled from the community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Contact details for organizers can be found [here](link-to-organizers).

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the community or its members. Examples of representing a community include using an official community e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
